# Congestion indigestion

Left to their own devices people cluster, people congest.

Congestion, an absence of flow. Sounds like indigestion, constipation. Just as comfortable I reckon. 

Gravity, it takes prisoners.

You have to step outside of it to see it. Some people do see it.

Look for these bright stars, and follow them. Theyâ€™ll give you the velocity to escape.

It just takes a person to keep the flow moving, someone who sees the congestion.
